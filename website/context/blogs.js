It simply means that if we are willing to learn from different manifestations of nature, then the nature is willing to teach us many of its virtues.",

Hence, those who use lower time frames, such as a 30-minute chart, will have to check the chart every half an hour and execute trades accordingly.

Beginners are under the wrong assumption that chart reading should be done quite fast and exit made at the earliest. As the market is very complex, they prefer to enter for a limited amount of time, take the trade, and exit at the earliest. This is because of the fear that something may go wrong if they remain in the market for longer period of time. This fear is partly because they do not realize the importance of identifying the trend and following it. Therefore, while doing a chart reading, they are not ready to wait for longer time to observe and analyse price movements, and open a position and exit at the safest point.
